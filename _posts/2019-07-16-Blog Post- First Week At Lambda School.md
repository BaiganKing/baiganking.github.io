## My First Week At Lambda School.

Data science has always been interesting to me way before I even knew what it was. Finding the most effective strategy to a game or the most efficient route on a trip; these are all problems that can be solved with data science.

Thou data science was an interest of mine I’d always find it somewhat intimidating, thinking I’d never be able to work in a field due to lack of my intelligence or be able to get a formal education in the US without drowning in debt from student loans. Fortunately, I found out that a code boot-camp was an alternative to attending a traditional university and a career in the information technology field can be pursued without a degree. This discovery led me to Lambda School, which after research, I quickly noticed it was far more accessible in comparison to its competition.

Lamba School is remote, so location isn’t an issue and an extremely flexible payment option which immediately caught my attention. This being I could attend the entire course Lambda was offering for zero upfront and would only repay them once I was employed. Seeing this showed me the confidence Lambda has in educating its students and being enrolled, I can see the passion that some of the staff have for data science.

The first week of Lambda so far has been nothing but motivating thus far. The lectures feel interactive and somewhat replicate a traditional classroom setting where you can have your questions answered and collaborate with other students. Assignments are neither too easy or challenging to encourage ‘Google-Fu’ skills which will be extremely useful moving forward, and if you need help, there are Team Leads which are always there to assist if you are stuck on a topic.

My experience with Lambda School for the first week has been inspiring, and I look forward to the rest of the program moving forward.
